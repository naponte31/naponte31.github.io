        <h2> How my K-12 experience in New York compares to Maryland School Districts </h2>

      <p class=padding>Growing up in a white, middle-class, suburban county on Long Island, New York, going to school was just a part of everyday life. Waking up at 7 a.m., eating frozen waffles for breakfast, and shuffling out the door to my elementary school were normal. John Street School in Franklin Square, NY, had a rigorous curriculum with state-of-the-art technology. As a young girl absorbing knowledge each day, it was hard to realize how lucky I was. </p>

      <p> Elementary school prepared me for high school. I attended a private, Catholic school just 20 minutes away from my hometown. I had the luxury of learning my entire education on a school-provided iPad, with Apple TVs in every classroom. Those resources allowed my high school to have a 100% graduation rate in 2020, with 95% of graduates enrolled in a Bachelor’s Degree program. </p>

      <p> Looking back now, I took all of those experiences and resources for granted. The money that both my public elementary school and private high school had allowed me to flourish and grow within my education. The sad reality is that poorer counties across the country have a lack of funding based on the surrounding areas in which they inhabit. “Money matters in terms of the kind of programming we can provide,” Dr. George Theoharis said. “Money matters in terms of the robustness in terms of the early childhood, pre-kindergarten experience we give kids.” </p>

      <p> Dr. George Theoharis is a K-12 education expert. He’s worked in elementary schools across the country as a teacher and administrator before making his way to Syracuse University 17 years ago. At the University, he is a professor of Educational Leadership and Inclusive Education and has served as the Education Department chair. </p>

      <p> “We don’t have direct evidence that says kids from low-income families can’t learn or are not as capable of learning compared to middle- or upper-class families,” Theoharis said. “As a part of our assumption, this is the way it is. But, it’s not the way it is. It’s the way we will let it be.” </p>

      <p> The education gap is not specific to one place but can happen anywhere in the United States. “It is always hard to see kids having a less than ideal educational experience. There are pockets of that everywhere,” Theoharis said. The public school education system in Maryland is the paragon of what it means for underfunded schools to have low success rates. “Particularly, in the Northast and the Midwest is hyper-segregation,” Thoeharis said. “That’s segregation by race and by income.” The hyper-segregation that Theoharis defined can be represented by the Maryland public high school attainment rate from 2014 to 2018 per county (U.S. Census Bureau). </p>

      <p>The school districts in Maryland have extreme educational differences ranging from the annual number of high school graduates per county and the expenditures spent per student. The high school graduation rate in public schools in Maryland could possibly deal with per capita income in the counties which these schools are in. To understand why this is the case, it’s important to note the per capita income in Maryland counties. </p>

      <p> Out of the 24 counties in Maryland, let’s take a look at two counties in Maryland: Howard County and Somerset County. Based on FRED Economic Data, in 2018, Howard County had an annual per capita income of $76,499 and Somerset County had an annual per capita income of $29,978. That’s a difference of $46,521 in per capita income per year. “The way we fund schools is built on inequity because a huge part of school funding comes from property taxes,” Theoharis said. </p>

      <p>Higher per capita income in a county means higher property taxes. The success rate in school is directly related to per capita income in the state of Maryland. According to the Maryland State Department of Education, Howard County has an annual number of 4,025 public high school Graduates, and Somerset County has an annual number of 153 public high school graduates. Looking at the bigger picture, 61.4% of residents in Howard County have completed a Bachelor's Degree while only 15.7% of residents in Somerset County have completed a Bachelor's Degree. This data concludes that the more per capita income, the more success rates in public high schools and beyond in 4-year colleges. According to Theoharis, the funding schools receive is based on population size. Howard County is close to 300,000 in population, while Somerset is around 25,000 residents (U.S. Census Bureau). This could explain the gap in the number of public high school graduates in these two counties. Even still, there are more educational opportunities for residents of Howard County than in Somerset County. </p>

      <p> “Family income and poverty make life really hard,” Theoharis said. “A higher concentration of poverty, we know, requires more resources in terms of providing a robust education.” This can be seen in the money spent per student in each district. Taking a look at both Howard County and Somerset County, more money is spent on Somerset county students ($16,563) than on Howard County students ($15,449). According to Theoharis, this happens because underfunded schools utilize their money differently. There is no direct evidence that demonstrates poor kids aren’t as smart as rich kids. Some of the poorer counties have to spend more on each student every year to play “catch-up” in education based on competing school districts. </p>

      <p> “We often know kids from low-income families start off kindergarten with less school literacy and numeracy skills than compared their affluent peers,” Theoharis said. “That is because of other childhood education policies we have made.” The Maryland State Department of Education and the U.S. Census Bureau display that disparities exist in everyday life, often hidden from the public eye. </p>

      <p> Now, as a college sophomore, I realize how blessed I was in the education I received. It wasn’t just my grades that got me into the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. It was the funding, student-to-teacher ratio, and educational resources I had throughout my K-12 education that allowed my grades to be Syracuse University worthy. It has permitted me to pursue my dream of becoming a broadcast journalist. </p>

      <p> “You always hear that poverty is an inevitable trap for kids, in terms of their learning, we should expect them not to perform and that’s not true,” Theoharis said. Schools are expected to fix all of these problems, but the school districts aren’t at fault. “The way we support kids in education has been up to us,” Theoharis said. Simple solutions are not possible in this situation. It’s a long and complex problem that has plagued the United States through time. It’s time for us to be the leaders of a long-awaited change.</p>
